What is the confirmed duration of the project (in months)? 
Do you expect equal object distribution across all 3 releases? 
Is the 30:70 Onshore-Offshore split acceptable? If not, please suggest a ratio. 
Are the assumed working hours per month (160 hrs) accurate for your team? 
Do all roles (Associate to Director) participate equally across all releases? 
Do you have fixed headcount constraints for any role or region (onshore/offshore)? 
Should additional buffer (e.g., 10-15%) be added for testing/rework? 
Are there parallel project dependencies that could impact available capacity? 
Should we account for holidays or planned PTOs within the 3-month timeline?
